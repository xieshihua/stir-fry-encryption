# stir-fry-encryption
A password/key based with variable encryption block length encryption software.
Many encryption methods exist. However, I still create my own encryption method as a proof of an old idea while it has some practical value. My goal is to create a method that can make the simplest message encrypted with the simplest password look like a random string. In December 2021, my dear friend Zhu, Qian (朱谦）, one who truly understood me, passed away. During the days of mourning, the solution came into my mind, so I dedicated this encryption method to him.
Why is the method called Stir Fry Encryption? In stir fry, raw materials are cut into pieces, put into a wok, and then seasoning is added and mixed. In my encryption method, the password is cut into groups of bits, each group is rotated, folded together and then rotated again to achieve a certain level of randomness. The outcome is called seasoning. The seasoning is then combined with the original text, chopped into bits, rotated, and folded; just like what I do when cooking stir fry.
Flip is added into the Stir Fry Encryption process on 2022-05-19. The introduction of flip creates an asymmetric use of the encryption key and the message, hence prevents the encryption key from being compromised.
