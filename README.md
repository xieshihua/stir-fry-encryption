# stir-fry-encryption
A password/key based with variable encryption block length encryption software.
Why is the method called Stir Fry Encryption? In stir fry, raw materials are cut into pieces, put into a wok, and then seasoning is added and mixed. In my encryption method, the password is cut into groups of bits, each group is rotated, folded together and then rotated again to achieve a certain level of randomness. The outcome is called seasoning. The seasoning is then combined with the original text, chopped into bits, rotated, and folded; just like what I do when cooking stir fry.
